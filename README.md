PyBank dissects a for-profit company's monthly profit & loss over an 86 month period, seeking to identify the range of data, average change to each month's profit or loss, and which months had the greatest profit and loss.

PyPoll intends to assist a small municipality modernize its polling procedures by automating citizen vote counting and declaring a winner of a local election.
