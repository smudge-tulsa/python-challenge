TCC data analysis Python challenge

This repo contains the source data, Python code, and output of two prescribed data analysis projects: PyBank and PyPoll. These projects seek to employ fundamental data science best-practices to improve financial and electoral processes through the automation of basic descriptive statistics.

PyBank dissects a for-profit company's monthly profit & loss over an 86 month period, seeking to identify the range of data, average change to each month's profit or loss, and which months had the greatest profit and loss.

PyPoll intends to assist a small municipality modernize its polling procedures by automating citizen vote counting and declaring a winner of a local election.
